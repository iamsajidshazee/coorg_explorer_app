He founded the town to commemorate his meeting with General Robert Abercromby, his ally against Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, in 1791. Virajpet was the headquarters of Yedenalknad taluk. The first population comprised people who Vira Rajendra had in his predatory excursions swept away from Mysore. But, the people that fled to Virajpet were principally the inhabitants of Periyapatna, who were looking for protection when their town was destroyed by Tipu Sultan, to prevent its falling into the hands of the British.",
